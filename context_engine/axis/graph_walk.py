"""Shared graph-walk core for the axis expansion passes.

Five expansion passes (``role_lookahead``, ``cross_role_boost``,
``impact_traversal``, ``structural_neighbours``,
``inheritance_ancestors``) grew independently, each re-implementing the
same three things: a Cypher-injection-safe edge-pattern builder, a
workspace-scoped neighbour walk over a relationship whitelist, and a
file-bucketed dedup-and-cap. This module is the single home for that
shared mechanic.

What stays here:

  * ``_safe_rel_pattern`` — the one validated edge-pattern builder.
  * ``EdgeProfile`` — named relationship whitelists (PROXIMITY,
    REVERSE_CALL, AFFECTS, INHERITANCE, …) so a widening is made in
    one place and every pass sees it.
  * ``Neighbour`` — the flat row a walk returns (uid, name, file_path,
    depth, reach).
  * ``walk_neighbours`` — the parametric walk. ``direction`` and
    ``anchor`` cover the cases the passes need; ``exclude_tests``
    folds in the test-file fence; ``reach`` (distinct seeds reaching a
    neighbour) is returned so a caller can rank by structural
    centrality instead of Lance-scan order.
  * ``cap_by_file`` — the dedup + per-file + total cap shared by the
    file-level passes.

What deliberately does *not* live here: the per-pass *interpretation*
of neighbours (lookahead's kind→role injection, impact's
walk-tagging, inheritance's class anchoring choice). Those stay in
their modules — this core only finds and ranks nodes, it never
decides what a node *means*.
