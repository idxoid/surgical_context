# Surgical Context — Technical Concept

## 1. The Storage Trinity

Data is split across three stores, each optimized for its role.

**Neo4j** — graph topology only. Nodes: `File`, `Symbol`, `DocAnchor`. Edges: `CONTAINS`, `CALLS_DIRECT`/`CALLS_DYNAMIC`/`CALLS_INFERRED`, `COVERS`, `FROM` (with type classification), `DEPENDS_ON`, `IMPORTS`, `AFFECTS` (Phase 5 reverse dependencies). No code text, no file paths stored on nodes (ADR-001). ✅ Running via Docker.

**LanceDB** — local vector index for documentation chunks. Model: `all-MiniLM-L6-v2` (384-dim). ✅ Implemented.

**Local FS** — source of truth for all text content. Read on demand using line coordinates from graph.

## 2. The Sidecar Binary

External Python process. VS Code communicates via FastAPI (localhost HTTP). Fault-isolated: if sidecar hangs, editor stays responsive.

### Implemented endpoints

| Method | Path | Description |
|---|---|---|
| GET | `/health` | Liveness check |
| POST | `/index` | Index a project directory into Neo4j + LanceDB |
| POST | `/index/docs` | Index a documentation directory into LanceDB + DocAnchor graph |
| POST | `/ask` | Assemble `PromptContext`, query Ollama, return answer + JSON contract |
| POST | `/search` | Semantic search over indexed docs (LanceDB) |
| POST | `/overlay` | Push unsaved file content into memory |
| DELETE | `/overlay` | Clear overlay for a file (on save/close) |

### Context Arbitrator

Returns a typed `PromptContext` dataclass (`sidecar/context/arbitrator.py`):
1. Detect query intent from user question via `IntentClassifier` (Phase 6.1)
2. Fetch target symbol from Neo4j (uid, range); resolve file path via `(File)-[:CONTAINS]->(Symbol)`
3. Check In-Memory Overlay — if dirty version exists, read from memory (`is_dirty=True`)
4. Otherwise read code from disk by line range
5. Expand graph via BFS (token-budget constrained) to gather all `CALLS` dependencies + reverse deps
6. Compile context tier-aware per intent: code → cross-refs → specs → architecture → concepts → ideas
7. Attaches doc chunks from LanceDB to `PromptContext.documentation` (respects tier priority)
8. `to_system_prompt()` → flat text for LLM; `to_dict()` → JSON Prompt Contract with `mode` + `intent` fields

### Intent Classification & Graceful Degradation (Phase 6.1)

`IntentClassifier` (`sidecar/context/intent_classifier.py`):
- Detects one of 6 query intents: **navigation** ("where is X?"), **debugging** ("why does X fail?"), **refactor** ("rename X everywhere"), **exploration** ("how does X work?"), **new_feature** ("add X"), **design_question** ("how should we approach this?")
- Each intent has a unique 6-tier priority: `[code, cross_refs, specs, architecture, concept, idea]` orderings vary
- Example: navigation prioritizes code + cross-refs; new_feature deprioritizes code, prioritizes ideas/concepts

`PromptCompiler.compile_with_intent()`:
- Fills context tiers in priority order per detected intent
- Graceful degradation: if a tier is empty, proceeds to next tier
- If all tiers exhausted → `mode = "standard"` (no surgical context, bare LLM call)
- Otherwise: `mode = "surgical_full"` (code + graph) or `mode = "surgical_doc_only"` (docs only)

PromptContext now includes:
- `mode`: indicates which context tier(s) populated the response
- `intent`: the detected query intent (for observability + model routing in Phase 6.3)

### In-Memory Overlay

`InMemoryOverlay` holds `{file_path: content}` for unsaved files. On `POST /overlay`, re-parses symbols from in-memory content via tree-sitter — no disk access. Cleared on save or close.

---

## 3. Indexing Pipeline

Two-phase to ensure all nodes exist before edges are created:

**Phase 1 — Symbol extraction** (per file):
- tree-sitter AST query for `function_definition`, `class_definition`, and module-level UPPER_CASE assignments (`variable`)
- Extract: name, kind, start/end line, content hash, UID (`sha256(file_path:name)`)
- Multi-language: Python (`.py`) + TypeScript (`.ts`, `.tsx`); gitignore-aware file collection
- Neo4j upsert: `MERGE (s:Symbol {uid})`, `MERGE (f)-[:CONTAINS]->(s)`

**Phase 2 — Call linking** (per file):
- tree-sitter query for `call` nodes
- Walk up AST to find enclosing function (caller)
- Neo4j: `MERGE (caller)-[:CALLS]->(callee)` matched by name

**Phase 3 — Symbol embeddings:**
- Read each symbol's source lines from disk
- Embed code bodies into LanceDB `symbols` table

**Phase 4 — Pending DocAnchor resolution:**
- `resolve_pending_anchors()` checks LanceDB `docs.pending` against newly indexed symbols
- Creates `[:COVERS]` edges for any identifiers now present in graph

---

## 4. Vector / Doc Layer

**Doc indexer** (`sidecar/indexer/docs.py`):
- Walks directory for `*.md` files
- Section-aware chunking: splits on `#`/`##`/`###` headings first; word-window fallback (400 words, 80 overlap) for oversized sections
- Embeds with `sentence-transformers/all-MiniLM-L6-v2`
- Upserts into LanceDB (delete-then-insert per file)
- Calls `link_docs_to_symbols()` after indexing

**LanceDB client** (`sidecar/database/lancedb_client.py`) — two tables:
- `docs`: `id, file_path, chunk, pending: list[str], vector[384]`
- `symbols`: `uid, name, file_path, code, vector[384]`
- `search(query, limit)` — ANN over docs table
- `search_symbols(query, limit, threshold)` — ANN over symbols table with cosine distance filter
- `get_pending()` / `set_pending()` — lazy DocAnchor resolution state

**DocAnchor** (`sidecar/indexer/anchor.py`) — Neo4j node with only `chunk_id` property.
- `[:FROM]` edge to `File` node (source doc file)
- `[:COVERS]` edges to `Symbol` nodes (semantic + identifier matching)
- Unresolved identifiers stored in `docs.pending` (LanceDB); resolved on every index run via `resolve_pending_anchors()`

## 5. LLM Integration

**Current:** Ollama (`llama3` default, `OLLAMA_MODEL` env override). Stateless — single system + user message per request.

**Planned:** Official Anthropic SDK (`sidecar/ai/engine.py` has commented implementation). Activation deferred to Phase 5.

---

## 6. ADR Summary

**ADR-001** — Code text stays on FS, only topology in Neo4j. Keeps graph lightweight and code off SaaS.

**ADR-002** — Python sidecar for MVP. Best ecosystem for tree-sitter + AI libs. Compiled to binary (Nuitka) at launch.

**ADR-003** — Shared SaaS graph + Local Dirty Overlay. Team shares one Neo4j Aura graph; local unsaved changes handled in-memory only.

**ADR-004** — Model round-robin by intent + context size. Simple → cheap model, complex → powerful model.

**ADR-005** — LanguageAdapter protocol. All language-specific logic (tree-sitter queries, call resolution) lives behind a protocol so new languages plug in without core edits.

**ADR-006** — Quality gates before SaaS. Phase 4 (SaaS) and Phase 5 (launch) are blocked until Phase 2.5 (eval harness + metrics) and Phase 3.5 (incremental indexing + token budget) are green.

---

## 7. Dev-Phase Priorities

The project is pre-release. SaaS and marketplace are deferred. The active work stream is:

1. **Phase 2.5 — Quality Foundation.** Eval harness, structured logging, `/metrics` endpoint, token accounting. Every claim in §1 of the architecture doc must be measurable before it can be scaled.
2. **Phase 3.5 — Arbitration & Indexing Robustness.** Incremental `/index/file`, token-budget-driven BFS instead of hardcoded `*1..2`, re-ranking (callers > callees), `IMPORTS` / `DEPENDS_ON` edges.
3. **Extension scaffold.** The "thin client" half of the architecture does not yet exist on disk — a `extension/` workspace with a minimal chat window is a Phase 1 gap.

Phase 4 and 5 remain on the road map but are explicitly blocked on the above (see ADR-006).
